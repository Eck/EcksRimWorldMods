# EcksRimWorldMods
A public repo for my learning-to-mod Rim World efforts.

## Clean Clothes/Repair Mod

FourToo asked for the source code for my Clean Clothes and Repair mods. I'm not sure what state I left that in, but here it is. Hopefully it's useful. :D

## Build/Deploy Notes
I can't remember what state I left this in, but it's probably hardcoded to my setup. Checkout the Readme in the PlagueGun tutorial and see if that helps you get things going.
